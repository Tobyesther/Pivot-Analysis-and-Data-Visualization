# Pivot-Analysis-and-Data-Visualization

üîπ**TASK 1**

‚ùÑ**Introduction**

The second week for the 3rd Cohort data analysis class featured Pivot Tables and Data Visualization, assigned by Promise Chinonso.For this task, we were presented with a medical student dataset and asked to fill in the blank cells with the average of each column in the sheet. Using pivot table, we were asked to calculate different parameters and visualize our result using the Pivot charts.



‚ùÑ**QUESTIONS:**

- Using the Medical Students Data, create Pivot Tables displaying the following:
- Average values for the following for Male and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)
- Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places)
- Number of students across the different Blood Groups
- Number of Students who smoke and those who don‚Äôt
- Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don‚Äôt.



‚ùÑ**FUNCTION USED**
- Pivot Table
- PivotTable Analyze

--------





‚ùÑ**SOLUTIONS:**
- The average values of both gender for the given parameters was derived using the pivot table by clicking on the 'Insert' function and then 'Pivot Table' function
  after highlighting the sheet containing the medical student dataset. A drop down box was opened and i clicked on 'new worksheet'. A new sheet was opened and a
  dialogue box containing the a list of parameters from the medical students data. From the parameters, the gender was dragged to the 'Row box', the age was dragged
  to the value box, while the BMI, Temperature, Heart rate, Blood pressure and cholesterol were moved to the column box.
- This then gave a breakdown of the sum of each parameters for both gender. After, we substituted the sum for the average since we were asked to calculate the
  average of each parameters by double clicking on the Sum column, which brought a dialogue box with different options. Then i clicked on the average option and it
  brought out the average. This was repeated for all the parameters.

- The average height and weight was calculated for both genders using the same method in the previous question. Similarly, the gender was moved to the row box while
  the weight was moved to the value box and the height was moved to the column box. Hence, given us the sum of these parameters, after which we calculated the 
  average by double clicking the sum column and tehn clicking on average in the drop down box displayed.

  ----------





- The number of students across the different blood groups was calculated by highlighting only the blood type column in the medical student dataset. After this, i
  clicked on 'Insert' and then pivot table. The blood type option was dragged to the row box and the value box showing the different blood groups and the number of
  students having these blood types.

  ----------





- The non- smoking and smoking category of students was calculated by highlighting only the Smoking column and it was dragged to the row box and the value box
  showing the number of stdents that smokes and those that don't.

  ---------





- Lastly, the number of diabetic and non diabetic students was derived by highlighting only the diabetes column and moving it to the row box and the value box
  in the pivot table giving us the number of students that have diabetes and those that do not have diabetes.

‚ùÑ**DATA VISUAIZATION**

- We were asked to carry out data visualiztion for the results above. Data visualization generally refers to the graphical representation of data, it helps us to
  present complex information in a clear and visually appealing form.

  - The following chart Shows the visual representation of my results from Averge height and weight of the students, The number of blood types of students, the number of students that smoke and those who don't and the number of students that have diabetes and those that don't have.

‚ùÑ**CONCLUSION:**

- Pivot table employs different options and dimensions of calculations and it basically simplifies any calculation coupled with an option of data visualization with ease. 
  Overall, the class was enlightening and well detailed with practice questions.
